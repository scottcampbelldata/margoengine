# @margoengine/animator

Optional gameplay animation on the existing `@margoengine/animation` skinning pass. Named states select clips, 1D trees interpolate neighboring samples, and 2D trees use normalized inverse-square distance weights with exact sample reproduction. State transitions crossfade a captured pose into the destination. Masked additive layers apply translation/scale/quaternion and morph deltas relative to a sampled reference pose.

```ts
import {EngineKernel} from '@margoengine/core';
import {loadGLTF} from '@margoengine/gltf-pro';
import {Animation} from '@margoengine/animation';
import {Animator} from '@margoengine/animator';
const engine = await EngineKernel.create(document.querySelector<HTMLCanvasElement>('#viewport')!, {backend:'webgpu'});
const model = await loadGLTF(engine, '/hero.glb'); // clips named Idle, Walk, Run
const animation = Animation.attach(model);
const animator = Animator.attach(animation, {
  initial:'locomotion', parameters:{speed:0},
  states:{
    locomotion:{parameter:'speed', samples:[{value:0,clip:'Idle'},{value:1,clip:'Walk'},{value:3,clip:'Run'}]},
    idle:'Idle'
  },
  transitions:[{from:'locomotion',to:'idle',when:p=>p.speed<0,duration:0.15}]
});
animator.parameters.speed = 2;
engine.start();
```

For a 2D state use `{parameters:['strafe','forward'],samples:[{value:[0,0],clip:'Idle'},...]}` with unique coordinates. Parameters default to zero. 1D samples must be strictly increasing. Clips loop independently in seconds. `transition(state,duration)` switches states explicitly; predicates are evaluated in declaration order, at most once per frame. Add a layer with `addLayer({clip:'Aim',weight:0.5,mask:[upperBodyNodeIndex,...]})`. Masks use glTF node indices. The returned function removes the layer; mutable weights are validated each frame. `referenceTime` defaults to zero.

`addFootIK({hip,knee,ankle,pole,raycast,offset,probeHeight})` requires a direct three-node leg chain. The callback receives a world-space origin above the current ankle and a downward ray. Return `{position,normal?}` or `null`; supply terrain collision data or an existing BVH. For `AssemblyBVH`, adapt its result with `hit ? {position:hit.point} : null`. Normals align the ankle's local +Y with the terrain. Bones/ancestors require positive uniform scales. Unreachable targets clamp to the leg's reach; the pole chooses the knee bend direction. `solveTwoBoneIK()` is also exported as a standalone analytical solver.

Animator owns pose playback while attached: it pauses `Animation`, updates node transforms/morph weights before world-matrix evaluation, and lets that same animation pass write its existing bone palette storage buffer and deform vertices. There is no second skinning buffer or pass. Attach `Animation` first. Unloading the model removes both plugins; disposing the animator restores the prior playback flag. Removing Animation also removes its animator on the next update. GPU restoration retains gameplay state. Core/stage stay frozen.
